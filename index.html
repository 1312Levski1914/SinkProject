                    <p>We send our staff to visit you house and install cold/hot potable water mechanical valve which is mounted to the wall under the sink using supplied bushings and screws, with the water flow directions arrow pointing up. The valve's inlet ports connect to the water supply hoses provided with the unit. The outlet ports connect to the hot/cold hoses from the faucet.</p>

                <p><span class='makeMeBlue'> <strong> What </span> Is Our Goal </strong></p>
                <p>Save water worldwide, we think it's the right time to come up with this idea, because of the debates about solving climate change problems, but not so much action towards that direction. We also need to gain more partners and supporters and grow bigger as a company for our goal to be relevant. Small business don't have big enough recognition in society in order to be heard and change climate change issues.</p>
